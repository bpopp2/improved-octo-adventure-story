	In the sea there was once an octopus named Admirabilis.
They had lost their parents who went missing one night when they were only a year old.
Admirabilis was taken in by some wise elders of the community, who told them that their parents were killed by fishermen.
After Admirabilis became an adult, one of the elders told them about the truth of their parents.
Admirabilis, feeling both betrayed and hopeful, decided to leave the community and take a journey to find their parents. 

	Admirabilis knew it would be difficult to find their parents, for the elder only reluctantly told him they were alive
in the first place, refusing to give any sort of guidance as to how to find them. He picked a direction and started
swimming. He would search the whole sea if he had to. After all, after what his parents sacrificed for him, it was the
least he could do.

Admirabilis continued the search for their parents and swam past many fish that did not look like them. Admirabilis saw some fish that were forty times their own size and other fish that were barely the size of their eye. Many fish chased Admirabilis but they were always able to get away by shooting ink at the other fish. Admiribilis eventually found their parents many miles from their home. They welcomed Admirabilis and everyone lived happily ever after.  

However, the story is not end here.
At first, Admirabilis felt so happy to re-unite with his parents.
But as the time fleets, he began to realize something strange.
His parents did not look like him. Admirabilis had blue skin while his parents had color of orange.
So one day, Admirabilis asked his parents"Do you miss the life at Otaku Sea?"
"Where is that my son?" Asked by his parents. Admirabilis sarted to feel thrilling, Otaku Sea was the place he borned.
